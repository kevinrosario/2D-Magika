### The following **required** functionality is implemented:

### Debug Commands:

- [x] Implement the keyboard button ‘N’ so that when pressed you can skip to then next world.
- [x] Implement the keyboard button ‘I’ to regenerate health.

### Implement new minor features

- [x] Make the door in world1 invisible.
- [x] Implement a new item that is a stick.
- [x] Implement a bush object for ‘world1’ that drops a random amount of sticks
- [x] Implement a new item and set the skeleton enemy to drop it when killed
- [x] Implement a chest object that will open when you press ‘E’ in front of it and tell the player, in some way, that he has to deliver 3 ‘sticks’ and 3 of the items previously implemented.
- [x] Make it possible that the player can deliver these items to the chest and the door will appear when delivered. Whichever way it was implemented it should dynamically update (it should tell the player, either at demand or constantly) how many items are remaining to be delivered. This is the first world1’s quest.

### Implement at least 1 New enemy

- [x] Done.

### Implement at least 1 new world

- [x] Each world should have a different set of blocks composing it, a different size, and world structure.

### For each new world the main character (The player) must be able to do the following:

- [x] Have at least one new quest(mission) that will let you progress to the next stage.

### Give the game a purpose:

- [x] Implement a “game beaten” condition and screen.
- [x] Display to the player that they died.

### Creative Directions (Optional):

- [x] Have a health bar for the enemies. This should represent the monster’s remaining health.
- [x] Add a boss for one of the quest.
